Smart contracts to automate finances

## Background
Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic.
Fortunately, you've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What you will be doing this assignment is creating 3 ProfitSplitter contracts. These contracts will do several things:


Pay your associate-level employees quickly and easily.


Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.


Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.

## Contracts
- First Contract
  - AssociateProfitSplitter This contract accepts Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the recipient associate level employees. This will increase the efficiency of human resource departmnet as well as minimize the human effort.

- This contract was deployed and tested on Ropsten Test Network.
